# miniAna
An Igor Pro procedure with offers an analytical environment for miniature events, written to analyze miniature EPSCs recorded in in vitro brain slice preparation of mice.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* tUtility (https://github.com/yuichi-takeuchi/tUtility)
* SetWindowExt.XOP (http://fermi.uchicago.edu/freeware/LoomisWood/SetWindowExt.shtml)

This code has been tested in Igor Pro version 6.3.7.2. for Windows and supposed to work in Igor Pro 6.1 or later.

### Installing
1. Install Igor Pro 6.1 or later.
2. Put GlobalProcedure.ipf of tUtility or its shortcut into the Igor Procedures folder, which is normally located at My Documents\WaveMetrics\Igor Pro 6 User Files\Igor Procedures.
3. SetWindowExt.xop or its shortcut into the Igor Extensions folder, which is normally located at My Documents\WaveMetrics\Igor Pro 6 User Files\Igor Extensions.
4. Optional: SetWindowExt Help.ipf or its shortcut into the Igor Help Files folder, which is normally located at My Documents\WaveMetrics\Igor Pro 6 User Files\Igor Help Files.
5. Put miniAna.ipf or its shortcut into the Igor Procedure folder.
6. Restart Igor Pro.
